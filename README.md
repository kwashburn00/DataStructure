# DataStructure
  Part 1: Research
    - Linked list allows efficiency with inserts and deleting without moving around elements like an array or a list. 
      A linked list is used when you need to insert or remove items from the middle of a collection frequently. 
    - Stack vs Queue: uses a Last-In-First-Out(LIFO) order, which allows the last item(s) to be added will be the first to be removed.
      A queue uses First-In-First-Out(FIFO) order, so the first item(s) added will be the first to be removed.
    - You'll want to use an array when the size of your data is fixed and known ahead of time, when efficiency or performance is a priority.
